# abopt

Abopt is a toolkit for antibody optimization and antibody cocktail selection to target viral escape. This tool is built with anndata and has a Python based API; it  includes antibody/virus fitness landscape generation and visualization, feature selection for antibody optimization, and an optmization algorithm that solves for antibody cocktails to address viral escape. This tool works with antibody sequence data and antibody and virus mutational scanning data/fitness lanscapes that can be generated experimentally or approximated using energy minimization tools like FoldX.
